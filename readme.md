# Vend Postman

A Postman Collection for Vend API Endpoints

# Usage

This Collection uses Postmans Environment Variables, so all you have to do is create an Environment and set your variables to use this collection. The variables you need to specify are:

- domainprefix
- token

There are other variables which have purposely been left which you will need to set depending on the request, like unique Product/Sale/Customer IDs.
